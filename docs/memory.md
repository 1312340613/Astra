Astra keeps a small core memory, searchable history and reusable skills. Each has a different purpose and lifecycle.

## Core memory and task state

Core memory is global and intentionally small. `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` are
the direct always-injected sources of truth, not mirrors of SQLite records.
They use fixed hard limits and are added to temporary context for the current turn;
the persisted user message remains unchanged. Core Markdown currently has no
project-folder scope.

Durable execution uses `TaskRun → Step/TaskEvent` in `.astra/tasks.db`.
Every request receives an independent TaskRun with checkpoints, tool results,
blocking state, cancellation, and verification evidence. Use `/tasks` to inspect
the execution journal. Long-horizon work is opt-in through `/goal`, which adds
independent verification and bounded automatic continuation without guessing
intent from ordinary conversation.

Coding journals record what commands actually did: terminal status, exit code,
and bounded output. A successful command or file readback does not certify a
source change; `/tasks` shows these receipts as **UNVERIFIED** until assessed.
Background and interrupted executions remain distinct from completed commands.
The model should report relevant checks and their limits without repeating checks
just to dismiss a reminder. Goal verification includes command arguments and
both ends of long output; a completion verdict with empty evidence cannot finish
a goal. The verifier remains a model judgement, not a guarantee of correctness.

Routine requests do not inject a duplicate task ID, `running` label, or original
question. A compact `<task-state>` is included only when the journal contains
recovery, blocking, scheduling, or tool progress worth carrying forward. It is
capped at 1,000 characters, omits LLM bookkeeping, and prioritizes uncertain tool
outcomes over recent successes. This uses actual task state, not input keyword
matching or an extra model call. The turn's context stays frozen across tool
iterations; `/tasks`, checkpoints, and explicit resume retain the full journal
and original objective.

Session-isolated working memory in `.astra/memory.db` is now injected as
small `<conversation-state>` only: temporary constraints, open questions,
assumptions, and turn notes. Legacy goal/plan/progress/artifact fields and plan
APIs remain readable for compatibility, but are no longer execution truth and
are not injected into the prompt.

Always-visible memory has exactly two direct Markdown sources: `MEMORY.md`
(hard limit 2,200 characters) and `USER.md` (hard limit 1,375 characters).
Writes that exceed either fixed limit are rejected, and a second read-side guard
prevents legacy or manually edited oversized files from expanding the model
prompt. There is no Auto Core and no configurable extra L0 budget.

Structured historical memory is stored locally in `.astra/memory.db` and does
not require Hindsight. Evidence-backed preferences, user facts, episodes, task
references, and observations retain provenance, confidence, and lifecycle
metadata. Core Markdown remains the small always-visible source; SQLite records
are retrieved only when relevant, at most four records and 2,400 rendered
characters per turn. Project/configuration questions can match local
observations without requiring the user to say “remember”; trivial turns,
slash commands, and unrelated questions skip automatic recall. SQLite FTS5 is
used when available, with deterministic substring fallback for Chinese text.

Personal facts and corrections are written through the model's memory tools or
explicit `/memory` commands. Astra does not turn conversation sentences into facts
using patterns such as “I like”, “remember”, or “change to”. Optional tool-authored
retention is off by default (`MEMORY_AUTO_RETAIN=0`); enabling it admits only tools
that explicitly provide attributable evidence from successful calls. Diagnostics
show the active runtime setting. Old `conservative` / `evolving` mode values still
load, but both use this restricted tool-evidence policy.

Background memory maintenance only expires explicit deadlines and retires exact
observation duplicates with matching provenance, scope and lifetime. It preserves
the original records, does not increase confidence for repetition, and does not
promote temporary episodes into permanent facts. Existing memories are not
rewritten on upgrade; use `/memory inspect`, `correct` and `forget` to review them.
Semantic recall treats ordinary English words in Chinese questions as soft terms;
explicit literals and code identifiers still constrain matching results.

Hindsight is an optional federated semantic-recall enhancement. When enabled,
its results are merged with the authoritative builtin store; when disabled or
unavailable, builtin retention and recall continue locally. Current user
statements, Core Markdown, concrete TaskRun results, Goal state, and temporary
conversation state always take precedence over recalled records.

## On-demand history and learned skills

The model can use `session_search` to find earlier conversations, fixes and
environment observations when relevant. Archives persist after the terminal
closes. They are not copied into always-visible memory. See
[local history retrieval](local-history-retrieval.md) for filters,
bounded expansion and stale-evidence handling.

Reusable procedures use the skill library. Only its catalog is injected;
`skill_view` reads full instructions on demand. The model's own summaries and
user-added skills have separate ownership. `/learn review` manually checks the
next batch of automatic skills; it excludes user skills and does not execute
their procedures. See [skill learning](skill-learning.md) for migration,
cursor progress, protections and undo.

## Memory commands

```text
/memory
/memory remember <stable agent or environment fact>
/memory remember-user <stable user profile or preference>
/tasks [id]
/memory working temporary_constraints <temporary constraint>
/memory inspect [query|id]
/memory timeline <id>
/memory why
/memory correct <id> <replacement text>
/memory forget <id>
/memory clear-working
```

The model can use the `memory` tool to maintain the same stores. Credential-like
content is rejected. `MEMORY.md` defaults to 2,200 characters and `USER.md` to
1,375 characters. Core additions do not require approval; model-initiated
deletion is blocked until the user explicitly runs `/memory forget <id>`.

## Proactive Context Index

The Proactive Context Index is Astra's **native, optional memory recommendation
pipeline**. Query planning, reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF), diversity selection
(MMR), evidence budgets, and feedback all run in Astra's Python components.
It requires no external memory framework, memory server, graph database, or
auxiliary LLM. Existing embedding backends remain optional. It is **off by
default**, and ordinary Markdown core memory stays unchanged.

```text
/context-index session   # Astra's local records and session history
/context-index all       # Also consider cached Activity history
/context-index off       # Restore the existing memory path
/context-index why       # Explain the last selection and its cost
/context-index feedback R1 useful      # Explicit feedback on a displayed entry
/context-index feedback R1 irrelevant  # Lower its priority for similar tasks
/context-index feedback R1 outdated    # Ranking feedback; does not rewrite facts
```

Use [native memory recommendation](native-memory-recommendation.md) for
retrieval behavior, budgets, diagnostics, feedback and quality checks, and
[platform configuration](context-index-platforms.md) for optional embeddings.
The initial preview defaults to 900 characters (at most 2,000) and a 500-token
estimate. Context Index can return no recommendation; retrieved notes remain
historical evidence, not current instructions or proof of a fact.

## Importing Hermes history

The importer defaults to `~/.hermes/state.db` and the repository-local
`.astra/sessions.db`. Preview an import with explicit paths before writing:

```powershell
# Windows reading a Hermes database in WSL
python scripts/import_hermes_history.py --dry-run `
  --source-db "\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\your-name\.hermes\state.db" `
  --target-db ".astra\sessions.db"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux
python3 scripts/import_hermes_history.py --dry-run \
  --source-db "$HOME/.hermes/state.db" \
  --target-db ".astra/sessions.db"
```

After reviewing the preview, repeat without `--dry-run`. `HERMES_DB` and
`ASTRA_SESSIONS_DB` provide the same path overrides for scheduled runs; explicit
`--source-db` and `--target-db` arguments take precedence.

## Optional Hindsight service

Hindsight runs its own LLM for retain, consolidation and reflect. Astra's
`HINDSIGHT_PROCESSING_MODEL=deepseek-flash` is a diagnostic label only; it does
not change the server. On the Windows/WSL host running Hindsight, update its
actual service environment (for example `profiles/main.env`):

```dotenv
HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL=deepseek-flash
HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MODEL=deepseek-flash
HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MODEL=deepseek-flash
HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MODEL=deepseek-flash
```

Keep the existing DeepSeek provider, endpoint, credentials and bank settings.
Reload/recreate the service with this environment, including any separate
workers, and check its effective configuration. A plain container restart does
not import changes to a Compose env file. Per-operation or bank-level model
overrides must also agree; see the [Hindsight configuration reference](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/developer/configuration).
Pulling Astra alone does not update a separately deployed Hindsight service.
