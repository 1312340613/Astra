# Runtime profiling and diagnosis

[Home](../README.md) · [Documentation](README.md) · [简体中文](zh-CN/runtime-responsiveness.md)

Astra records optional timings to help distinguish model wait, tool execution,
storage and interface delivery. Enable `ASTRA_PROFILE_QUERY=1`, restart Astra,
reproduce the operation, then exit normally so accepted records can drain.

Run these commands from the installation checkout using its Python interpreter
(`.venv/bin/python` on macOS/Linux, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows):

```text
python -m agent.runtime.latency
python -m agent.runtime.query_profiler
python scripts/benchmark_runtime_responsiveness.py --samples 20 --lock-ms 150
python scripts/benchmark_runtime_responsiveness.py --samples 50 --lock-ms 0
```

## Profile files

`ASTRA_PROFILE_QUERY=1` writes `.astra/query-profile.jsonl` for model-request
stages and `.astra/runtime-profile.jsonl` for tool, storage and frontend stages.
With `ASTRA_HOME` set, both files live there. Runtime records use a bounded queue
and a 5 MiB file with two rotated backups. Dropped records, write errors and
unacknowledged samples appear in the final summary; an incomplete run reports
`complete: false`. Use `--generation ID` to inspect an older backend lifetime.
Profiling is off by default and does not change model or reasoning settings.

## Reading the results

| Stage | What it helps explain |
| --- | --- |
| Request preparation and first model event | Local preparation versus provider waiting |
| First reasoning and first answer | When different output channels become available |
| Tool queue, approval and execution | Waiting for admission versus work inside the tool |
| Result processing and persistence | Serialization, storage and delivery overhead |
| Frontend handling and React commit | UI processing after an event arrives |

Reports normally summarize the latest backend lifetime with sample counts,
median, p95, maximum and dropped-record counts. Each process uses its own
monotonic clock. A React commit is not a measurement of when terminal pixels
became visible. Timings are bounded, use sanitized identifiers and do not need
conversation text or raw tool output.

## Runtime behavior

Task and approval writes, session saves and Session Recall persistence run off
the event loop. A bounded, ordered event writer preserves delivery order and
applies backpressure. Tool admission still obtains a durable execution claim
before dispatch. Cancellation drains already accepted writes and retains unknown
outcomes so incomplete records cannot trigger automatic action replay.

This keeps slow storage from blocking unrelated controls. It does not make a
locked database finish its write sooner or reduce a model's reasoning budget.
Normal shutdown waits for accepted writes and worker cleanup.

## Terminal output failures

The live preview shares a bounded viewport with menus and input. Long drafts use
a cursor-following view; the submitted text and saved history remain complete.
Apple Terminal text previews are batched at 80 ms, with control events flushed
immediately in order.

Terminal writes run in an owned helper process so a blocked TTY cannot stop the
TUI control loop or hang its final exit. Pending output is limited to 4 MiB; five
seconds without write progress while bytes are pending marks the output failed.
Waiting for a model or user with no pending bytes does not trigger that timeout.

On failure, Astra stops rendering, requests backend shutdown and keeps draining
backend events while the active task is cancelled and the session saved. The
task records an interruption; reopening the session does not replay tools.
The backend has ten seconds to exit before termination is attempted. An event
writer that cannot drain stops waiting after two seconds. Forced shutdown cannot
guarantee that an in-flight external operation completed or that its latest
result was saved; check the restored interruption boundary before continuing.

`.logs/tui-terminal.jsonl` records output byte counts, peak backlog, write latency,
clear-screen requests, fault codes and whether shutdown needed termination. It
contains no conversation text or raw terminal stream. Restart Astra to load a
new TUI build. These safeguards do not establish or fix a native Terminal.app
or input-method crash cause; that still requires separate real-machine checks.

## Repeatable measurements

The benchmark uses temporary SQLite stores and controlled local workloads; it
makes no model requests. Compare the same workload with and without injected
lock pressure and retain failures and long-tail samples. It measures local
scheduling/persistence behavior, not network latency or general answer quality.

Save individual reports under `output/` or `.astra/artifacts/` with the commit,
platform and relevant configuration. Use a fresh fixed-condition measurement to
choose further optimizations; historical pass counts and one machine's timings
are not current release guarantees.
